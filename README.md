# Otherworld
My messy roguelike. Serious WIP. Game takes heavy inspiration from the novel "Heroes Die" by Matthew Woodring Stover.
Players will manage a studio that sends "actors" into a near earth dimension that is a fantasy world. Using BrainGoProâ„¢
audiences on earth will watch their favorite "actors" crawl dungeons, steal artifacts, and manipulate the Otherworld for
audience enjoyment.

Basic Roadmap:

    1. Basic Dungeon Crawler
    2. Studio Setup
    3. Advanced story generation
    4. World Simulation
